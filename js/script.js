title: "Reproduction Photograph: Signed Five American Presidents Photo/ Picture. Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush",
description: "Custom Archival Quality Photograph from my studio in Northern Nevada in the size you select. (((((Signed Reproduction Photograph: (Both Signatures and Photograph are Reproduction of the original signed photograph). ....just to be clear on that;))))) HANDLING TIME: (orders go out once a week via first class mail or first class mail international via USPS). About: From my studio in Remote Elko County, Nevada I create high quality reproductions of historical and interesting photographs. My store is new to Etsy, but I have been selling online on Ebay since 2004 (with over 7,500 feedback) and producing historical reproduction photographs since 2007. 4x6, 5x7, 8x10 and 8.5x11 are shipping in rigid cardboard-type mailing envelopes; while 11x17, 13x19 and 17x22 are shipped in cardboard shipping tubes first class mail with delivery confirmation/tracking. Over the past several years I have invested over 40,000 in my photo studio and equipment and I hope you find the reproduction to your liking! My prints are displayed in various small museums in Europe, Asia and North America, as well as Law Offices, Restaurants, Home Offices, Bedrooms, Living Rooms and everywhere in between! ;) I love being able to bring back these historical prints that I have collected from historical societies and other public domain repositories and museums worldwide. I am 40 miles from the closest post office (20 miles on dirt roads!!) ;) So I go once a week to drop off outgoing packages and documents. If for any reason you are not satisfied with your photograph please contact me before leaving me a negative review; and I will make any issue right. Each photograph is unique and was not originally made to be re-sized to the various modern sizes but I try to best I can and I feel I produce a very good reproduction (thanks to my Epson Pro Photo Commercial Equipment and a bit of experience;) I cannot speak for Etsy customers as I am a new store here; but with over 7,500 transactions on Ebay at 99.9% positive I believe I a providing a unique and great quality reproduction print. If you are looking for a particular topic or have a special request I will do my best to accommodate! Thanks again for your interest!",

title: "Vintage 1950&#39;s Ronald Reagan Union Pacific Railroad Train Travel Ad",
description: "Vintage Union Pacific Railroad travel and tourism ad, featuring Ronald Reagan long before he was president. Original page out of a 1959 magazine, not a copy or reprint, featuring the fabulous luxury Domeliner . Page measures 10&quot; x 6 3/4&quot; and is in wonderful vintage condition. Ride in style with a Union Pacific Domeliner! *************************IMPORTANT SHIPPING INFO*************************************** US Destinations * Item ships in a protective sleeve backed by rigid cardboard Non-US Destinations * Item ships in a protective sleeve backed by FLEXIBLE cardboard. If you want it shipped in rigid cardboard, you need to also purchase http://www.etsy.com/listing/122668910/rigid-cardboard-backing-for-shipping to cover the additional shipping cost. In 2013, the US Postal service doubled the shipping rates for lightweight international packages. Rigid envelopes must ship at the higher package rate ($7 Canada, $9 Everywhere Else), but flexible envelopes can ship at a much lower rate ($3 Canada, $5 Everywhere Else) . I&#39;ve started shipping in flexible cardboard in order to keep postage costs lower for my non-US customers. Please feel free to convo me with any questions and...Happy Shopping! Please visit me at my other Etsy shop zippitydoodle, zippitydoodle.etsy.com - more vintage goodies for your home and office!",

Prior to starting work on most personalized items we will provide a graphic version of the design for your approval with your information. This is only a digital mockup of the design; it will have sharp crisp lines, but remember all wood burning is done by hand and it will have handmade character. *fiveONEdesigns does NOT offer refunds or exchanges on personalized items.* Non-personalized item refunds will be determined on a case by case basis and fiveONEdesigns must be contacted prior to return. The cost of the product will be refunded. Shipping fees of initial purchase are non-refundable.

You are also responsible for purchasing tracking/delivery confirmation as well as insurance. IMPORTANT: if we don’t receive the product, or receive the product returned in a damaged condition, we will not provide a refund. ",
policy_additional: "Most of our products are created with wood. Wood has unique characteristics, including grain, knots, texture, etc. Due to these features each individual piece will be different. The image is burned into the wood by hand (not machines or lasers) and will not always have smooth lines and shading. This should not be viewed as flaws but rather as character and proof that the item is made by hand. Also, many of the items require glue. Wood glue does not stain well and therefore the item may have small visible amounts of glue where the stain could not penetrate to the wood. Most of the time this will be found insides of boxes in corners and edges. ",

title: "USSR Cold War Era Vintage CCCP Coin Cufflinks - Soviet Union 20 Kopeks",
description: "Hand Crafted Cufflinks, made with genuine coins from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (CCCP). Featured coin: CCCP 20 Kopeks (1961-1991) These cufflinks are new. When I look at this coin, with the Soviet &quot;CCCP&quot;, and the hammer and sickle superimposed over an image of the earth, memories of Soviet leaders standing watch before a parade of troops, tanks and missiles marching through red square comes to my mind. There was no doubt that the Soviets wanted to impose their socialist beliefs upon the entire planet. People today forget that during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s the greatest threat perceived by Americans was the Soviet Union. Thank you Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy, for your work keeping America free. These 20 Kopek coins were minted from 1961-1991, during the height of the cold war years. When you wear these cufflinks, people will notice them. The coins and the cufflink backs are silver color. The diameter of the coin is 22 mm. Both cufflinks show the same side of the coin: &quot;CCCP&quot; and the Soviet Union Coat of Arms. The coins have been made into cufflinks using high quality toggle backs, professionally soldered to the coins. We use solder, not glue! We take the extra time to make quality, durable cufflinks so that they will look great for years to come. I strive to have the best quality cufflinks on Etsy. The condition of the coins used will be consistent with the photo, but as with any hand crafted item, may vary slightly. Our cufflinks are made by hand in the U.S.A. The coins are cleaned and polished, and the result is great looking cufflinks ! Slight differences in the details of the coins add to the uniqueness of our cufflinks. Warranty: 1 year. Any cufflink found to be defective within 1 year of purchase will be repaired or replaced. We also offer a 7 day return privilege. We want you to be completely satisfied with your new cufflinks !",

description: "This Mixed Breed, Mutt or Rescue Dog is part of the Inspirational Dog Art Print Series. He is representing all mixed breeds, rescue dogs and shelter dogs. The quote is by Ronald Reagan. The print is avail in both the 5 x 7 size (matted to fit your 8 x 10 frame) and the 8 x 10 size (matted to fit your 11 x 14 frame). I use a crisp, white acid free mat. The back is labeled with the dog name and quote author if known. The print will be shipped in a clear cello sealed sleeve with an extra board to keep it from bending. Please be aware that the colors you see on your monitor may differ slightly from the actual colors of the print. The dog is deep turquoise blue and the branch is lime green or chartruese. If you would like a different quote or colors, please convo me with the desired quote and colors (from one of the other dog illustrations in my shop). Black frame is not included in this listing. It is simply used to showcase the print and mat. Other Inspirational and Motivational Dog Art Prints in the shop~ http://www.etsy.com/shop/goingplaces2 Watermark will not be on the print you receive.

description: "Classic Doonesbury comics Collection. This 1984 edition has an introduction by Gloria Steinem. The book is in excellent condtion, there is a 2&quot; tear at the top of the dustjacket. Book is 11.5 by 8 3/4 inches. From the Introduction: &quot;This proves the first virtue of Trudeau&#39;s work: it brings very diverse people together. Because Doonesbury&#39;s world stretches from campus to Washington, from American bedrooms and includes more varieties of characters than any other comic strip....Such bringing together could not be accomplished by papering over or downplaying real differences of opinion and Trudeau would never attempt that. On the contrary, he uses the differences themselves as the source of much of the humor in Doonesbury. &quot; I do ship worldwide, for destinations outside of North America I have given a rough estimate under &quot;everywhere else&quot;....please feel free to contact me for an accurate shipping quote for you.

If for any reason you are not satisfied with your purchase, simply return them for a full Money Back Guarantee! ☆ Free Worldwide Shipping ********************************************************* Please check my other items here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/PerfectCufflinks ********************************************************* ♥ A Word about Cufflinks: Appearing towards the end of the Renaissance period, primitive cufflinks were used for holding shirt cuffs together. The simple, bare design started to take a stylistic twist towards the mid-1600s. However it was the rip-roaring twenties that sent the cufflink on a popularity boom. It was once believed that one should never buy their own set of cufflinks. That cufflinks were a gift meant to mark an extraordinary occasion. It was also used as a marker of class and wealth with metal, glass, and even diamond designs. Now a days cufflinks still make a remarkable gift but are more common placed. They still make high fashion, but instead of royalty they are the standard for the modern gentleman. From Disney characters sporting animated cufflinks to James Bond creating a legend in cufflinks, this little piece of fashion makes its mark. Cufflinks became a symbol of style, wealth, power, and poise. Women have now taken part in popularizing cufflinks with creative designs and delicate details. The history of cufflinks ebbs and flows and popularity keeps on rising as celebrities, and others showcase eye-popping and spectacular designs of cufflinks. This art form of cufflinks is one hard to master. When purchasing your own set make sure to consider the design, color, and your other accessories. Become part of the rage, find the cufflink that is calling your name, and add to the history of the cufflink.",
